# Now in this .py file we will write all our algo (algorithm) and if we apply it in code it is known as function.
# If we don t run it then technically it is known as module.

# To import your module go to the path where you have saved your python file and run it in python.

# After that you can import your module ,just write import and then name of your file.

# Now you can use the module functions, just write (name of file.name of function and then use it). eg faiz.lwsum(4,5)
